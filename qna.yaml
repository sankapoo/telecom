      - question: |
          Can the wireless Internet connection be misused?
        answer: |
          Yes, there is a possibility of the wireless Internet connection getting misused, particularly if the Internet access is provided through Wi-Fi. To avoid misuse, proper authentication with secured passwords and usernames should be used.
      - question: |
          Will keeping the modem on make any difference in the download limits?
        answer: |
          Yes, it can make a difference. When both the PC and modem are kept on, there may be a trickle of packets from the Internet into the system, even if the PC is not actively used. Therefore, it is advisable to turn off the modem when not accessing the Internet.
      - question: |
          What is the fair speed usage limit in case of an unlimited data plan?
        answer: |
          The fair speed usage limit is the threshold of data consumption up to which the subscriber receives the promised speed. Once this limit is exhausted, the speed is reduced as per TRAI guidelines.
      - question: |
          Even though broadband is not used frequently, still huge bills are received. What could be the reason?
        answer: |
          Broadband services come under various tariff packages with different download limits. Exceeding the permitted data limit incurs additional charges. Users should choose a package that suits their data usage.
      - question: |
          What is the minimum download speed prescribed for a broadband service provider?
        answer: |
          According to the Quality of Service regulations (Second Amendment, 2014), a minimum download speed of 512 kbps must be provided to individual subscribers.
      - question: |
          What is the permissible minimum broadband speed limit?
        answer: |
          As per TRAI's “Quality of Service standards for Broadband Services” (2006), a subscriber should receive at least 80% of the subscribed broadband connection speed from the ISP Node to the user.
      - question: |
          How can a subscriber measure the download speed of his broadband connection?
        answer: |
          Customers can check their download speed using the TRAI My Speed App, which typically displays the speed in Kbps.

      - question: |
          What is the eligibility criterion for receiving a Unique Porting Request (UPC)?
        answer: |
          A subscriber must meet several criteria: clearing outstanding dues, a minimum activation period of 90 days, no ongoing change of ownership, fulfillment of contractual obligations, and other checks (e.g., not being under legal prohibition or sub-judice, and waiting seven days post SIM swap/replacement).
      - question: |
          What is the procedure for Mobile Number Portability?
        answer: |
          The process includes generating a UPC by sending an SMS with the word 'PORT' and the mobile number, submitting the required forms and KYC documents, and then undergoing a porting process that typically takes 3 to 15 working days depending on the region.
      - question: |
          What are the grounds of rejection of a porting request?
        answer: |
          For individual subscribers, valid UPC typically prevents rejection. However, for corporate numbers, rejection may occur if the porting request is not supported by a valid authorization letter.
      - question: |
          How can a customer withdraw his porting request?
        answer: |
          A customer can withdraw the porting request within 24 hours by sending an SMS with the word 'CANCEL' followed by the mobile number. Note that any porting charges paid will not be refunded upon withdrawal.
      - question: |
          What is the validity period of UPC?
        answer: |
          UPC is valid for 4 days in most areas; in Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and North East, it remains valid for 30 days (excluding the day of generation).
      - question: |

      - question: |
          What are the charges to be paid for porting a mobile number?
        answer: |
          The charge per porting request is capped at six rupees and forty-six paisa, as specified by the recipient operator.
      - question: |
          Will the subscriber be informed about the porting process?
        answer: |
          Yes, subscribers are notified via SMS at every stage of the porting process including submission, scheduling, deactivation by the donor operator, and activation by the recipient operator.
      - question: |
          How can a telecom subscriber get information about the status of his MNP request?

      - question: |
          What is the role of TRAI in handling telecom consumer complaints?
        answer: |
          TRAI mandates that telecom service providers establish a two-tier complaint redressal mechanism. While it sets the framework, TRAI does not directly resolve individual complaints.
      - question: |
          How can I register my complaint?
        answer: |
          Complaints can be lodged at the Complaint Centre of the respective service provider. The details for registration are usually available on the provider's website.
      - question: |
          What happens when I register my complaint with the Complaint Centre?
        answer: |
          The Complaint Centre registers the complaint and sends an SMS with a docket number, registration date and time, and an estimated resolution time.
      - question: |
          What is the time limit for resolution of complaints at the Complaint Centre?
        answer: |
          Complaints should be resolved within a period not exceeding three days, or as specified under the applicable Quality of Service regulations.
      - question: |
          How will I know of the completion of action on my complaint?
